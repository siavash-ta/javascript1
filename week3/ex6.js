You want to buy a couple of things from the supermarket to prepare for a party.
After scanning all the items the cashier wants to give you the total price, but
the machine is broken! Let's write her a function that does it for her
instead!

1. Create an object named `cartForParty` with five properties. Each property
   should be a grocery item (like `beers` or `chips`) and hold a number value
   (like `1.75` or `0.99`).

2. Complete the function called `calculateTotalPrice`.

   - It takes one parameter: an object that contains properties that only contain
     number values.
   - Loop through the object and add all the number values together.
   - Return a string: "Total: â‚¬`amount`".

3. Complete the unit test functions and verify that all is working as expected.

const cartForParty = {
    beers: 1.75,
    chips: 0.99,
    bread: 1.5,
    egg: 0.5,
    cake: 2.01
};
let i;
let t=0;
function calculateTotalPrice(cost) {
    let newCartForParty={...cost};
  for (let x in newCartForParty){
t += newCartForParty[x];
console.log(t);
  }
}calculateTotalPrice(cartForParty);
